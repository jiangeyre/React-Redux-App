A state machine is a mathematical model of computation.

A machine can have a finite number of states, but it can only operate in one state at a given time.

There are different types of state machines, but for building UIs (and understanding Redux), weâ€™ll concentrate on the type that has an initial state. The next state is calculated based on input and the current state.

For our purposes, a State Machine has:

initial state (store).
current state (store).
inputs or actions (action creators) that trigger transitions (reducers) to the next state.
It helps to think in terms of states instead of transitions.

Redux is NOT a finite state machine, but the thinking in states helps our understanding of how Redux works.

A simple example would be an application that has two main parts: 1) a control dashboard, and 2) a display. The application can be expressed in states and actions like so:

current state	action (input)	new state
locked closed	unlock	unlocked closed
unlocked closed	lock	locked closed
unlocked closed	open	unlocked open
unlocked open	close	locked closed
unlocked open	lock	locked open
locked open	unlock	unlocked open
